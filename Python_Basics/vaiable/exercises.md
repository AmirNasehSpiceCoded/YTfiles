# Python Variables â€“ Exercises

This repository contains practice exercises about **Python variables**.  
Each exercise focuses on a different concept, from beginner to high-level.

---
### 1. Swap Without Temp Variable
ðŸ‘‰ Create two variables `a = 'bob'`, `b = 'john'`.  
Swap their values **without using a third variable**, then print them.

---

### 2. Track a Running Total
ðŸ‘‰ Write a program where a variable `total` starts at `0`.  
Ask the user **three times** to enter a number and keep adding it to `total`.  
At the end, print:  

---
### 3. Dynamic Typing Twist
ðŸ‘‰ Create a variable called `data`.  

1. Assign it an **integer**.  
2. Then assign it a **string**.  
3. Finally assign it a **list**.  

At each step, print the variable and its type using `type()`.

### 4. Simple Banking System
ðŸ‘‰ Make a variable `balance = 1000`.  
Then simulate these steps in order:

- Deposit 250  
- Withdraw 400  
- Deposit 120  

At each step, update the variable and print the current balance.  

ðŸ’¡ **Bonus:** Prevent the balance from going below 0.

### 5. Variable Value Tracing (Challenge)
ðŸ‘‰ Predict the final output before running this code:

```python
x = 5
y = x + 3
x = y - 2
y = x * 2
x = x + y
print(x, y)
````
